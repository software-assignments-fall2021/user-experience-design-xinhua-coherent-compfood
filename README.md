# Wireframes

All pages have a link on the top left for the homepage and the top right for a user's account information. Further all pages are linked to each other by order of subordination, where they are nested deeper in relation to a user's progress towards order completion.

## Home screen / restaurant list / where can I get the solid-form nutrients?

Here we have restaurant options layed out to the user, with basic info like distance and time for quick decisions. For more information on a particular restaurant, a user can press the go button, directing them to the restaurant info page for meal delivery options and additional info.

## Restaurant menu / what sustenance is available for me to receive?
Here a user can press the order button on the restaurant info page to then be directed to the menu. The menu displays all food items offered by the specific restaurant. The findapp button on the menu page then directs the user to all food delivery options for the selected choice.

## Previous orders / what did I receive those many days agoooo?

Here the user's order information is saved for their convenience. The meal itself is displayed so they can re-order meals. Meal prices are shown so the user can keep track of their spending and also compare prices shown today. Further, the app used is shown, allowing them to make informed decisions on their next order based on previous experience with the app they used last.
